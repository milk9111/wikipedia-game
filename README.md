Welcome to The Wikipedia Game!

The goal is to reach the target Wikipedia article topic by clicking through Wikipedia articles in the least number of article clicks. 

Only clicks to other wikipedia articles are counted. External links are not. 

You can choose your own starting and target topics or click the `Random` button if you want to just see what's out there. Be warned that Random can be quite difficult and lead to what could be considered "inappropriate" articles so use at your own discretion.

Any article topic you put in will be verified using Wikipedia's API to make sure it exists so I recommend using the search bar to find the `Official` name or google it beforehand and copy-paste. 

The game also comes with a collapsible history to show how far you've come.

If you want to play against some else, you can share the URL or click the `Shareable Link` button after you've started a game to copy the URL to your clipboard and send that to your opponent. This will automatically start a new game for them. They aren't connected in any way, but you can work it out amongst yourselves to see who reaches the target first. 

Good luck and have fun!
